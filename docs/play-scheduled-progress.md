# CardStashy Play development checkpoint

## October 24, 2026 — reference translation and CPU contracts

The supplied REA 6.7.0 archive was inspected directly. A guest Moxgate match
was exercised through opening-hand acceptance, land play, Bolt targeting,
payment and resolution. Official Arena documentation was checked for priority
controls, ninjutsu timing and payment/choice presentation. See
[reference observations](play-reference-observations.md) and
[CPU translation](play-cpu-reference-translation.md).

Added a standalone, versioned CPU observation/proposal contract with authored
fixtures. It rejects unauthorized evidence, stale decisions, unvalidated
proposals, absent response windows, unbounded loops and recurring mana deficits.
Review caught and corrected own-library identity exposure and unsafe aggregate
integer arithmetic. These are synthetic contract tests. The trusted engine
adapter and actual fair CPU policy remain unfinished; declaring a validation
witness in a fixture does not validate a real engine action.

Validation: 60 focused Node tests pass, including 18 new CPU reference tests.
This does not rerun or replace the separate actual-WASM mechanics evidence:
the original pinned runtime still has six passing scenarios and the preserved
missing-response-window ninjutsu failure. No playable board or CPU-strength
claim follows from this checkpoint.

The authoritative Rust ninjutsu correction is being developed separately in
an isolated worktree based on Phase commit
`71ccd8fe1715c45fe9e9bd78d391bec5ac8a4234`. Its current scope includes a typed
stack ability, paid activation costs, exact source/defender occurrences,
copied-ability controller handling and persisted entry continuations. Source
work in progress is not a corrected, rebuilt runtime and is not included in
this CPU-only checkpoint. Do not remove the failing runtime assertion.

Next: checkpoint/review the bounded source patch, then attempt a memory-limited
build with a serialized LLVM backend and MIR optimization disabled. The two
previous local LLVM builds exceeded the 8 GiB memory ceiling; changing Cargo's
job count alone did not solve that. Keep original artifact hashes distinct
from any corrected build. Then run actual rules/response/restore regressions
against the newly identified artifact before advancing the engine gate.

Keep all work on `codex/cardstashy-play-engine-20261024`. No production merge,
deployment, public Play activation, APK changes or migrations are authorized.
Check the current remote head before the next write and preserve newer work.
